# What kind of technical skills will be needed to complete your project? (150 word limit)

---

My project is aimed to be easily reproducible later on, however still it requires 3D modeling and CAD knowledge. Optics itself also doesn't seem to be hugely difficult, but knowledge of basic optics is also ideal at least in the testing phase. Laser experience would be vey handy as while 55mW isn't the most powerful laser possible, it is still somewhat dangerous. Programming LoRA and Arduino requires C, although it shouldn’t be too intense. Most importantly, fabrication skills being able to work with the various parts and assemble the structure together are important. This would be familiarity with 3D Printing, as well as general experience creating irregularly shaped devices and attachment methods.  

# What do you anticipate being the biggest obstacles in your project? (250 word limit)

I think the biggest obstacle in my project is aiming and atmospheric effects. The laser chosen has been tested to be stable at over 2x it’s initial power (citation Photolexicon) creating high enough power to transmit through most atmospheric aerosols, and also arid environments being targeted should mean that scattering is low, there’s always environmental effects that could mess up the beam. I plan on dedicating multiple weeks to figuring out how to best transmit laser data, whether increasing power, or having much lower repetition rate. I believe this will be an obstacle, but one that should be passable. That aside, aiming is definitely going to be an obstacle that will have to be overcome. As said, the spot is quite small, and being projected literal kilometers away, means that it will be a bit of a challenge to aim, even after building an aim guiding system, just due to the fine tuning necessary. To avoid wind and other obstacles, I  propose connecting the module to the top of houses or large buildings that should be fairly stable in production, however when testing on telescope mounts on the top of mountains stability will be an issue for sure. Finally, a major obstacle is clearly the fact that in order to test the technology, 2 or more people are required to separate a distance of more than 1-2 km, while still maintaining clear view of each other. This is less of an issue with the project itself, but more of a logistical hassle.

# Where do you believe that THINK mentorship can benefit your project? (250 word limit)

THINK Mentorship would be extremely valuable to my project, firstly, with helping fine tune designs, and possibly helping choose even better parts to help solve this initial problem. Optics wise, I’ve had most of my experience with telescopes and binoculars, and laser magnification isn’t something I'm extremely familiar with. I hope that if selected, THINK mentorship can help me maybe even improve my magnification setup, and achieve better than expected results out of data transmission. While I like to think of myself as decently handy, mentorship from experienced 3D printing and robotics engineers such as those at THINK and MIT would be beyond amazing in being able to help me fabricate and successfully assemble my project. It’s often easy to get unmotivated to do even really cool things, just due to roadblocks and obstacles, so having both mentors to ask for help when needed, as well as the encouragement and motivation of completing a THINK project in time would be greatly beneficial too improving my project and actually getting me to the finish line. Finally, I’ve done previous projects and every time, talking to experienced people in the field, tumbles from a quick “I have a question” moment to lengthy discussions about every part of my project, finding ways to improve and comment on everything. I know that in the end, there are indescribable benefits yielded by conversing with experts, and I think that itself is the most valuable part of THINK mentorship.

One of my major goals with this project, is also to create a system capable of telling operators how to move lasers into optimal positions, as well as figuring out how to best mitigate atmospheric effects.
